Asteroids Game:

Last Spring, I took the class CMPT*202 “Intro to Data Structures”. As part of the final project for this class we had to create an asteroids game. Throughout this project I learned how creative the field of computer science is. Since we could give each object the shape and color, we wanted it to be. Furthermore, it also strengthened my communication skills because every time I got stuck on a problem, I was able to ask the teacher or my peers. Asteroids game is a game which allows you to move a ship with the arrow keys in every direction. Moreover, is the ship able to shoot bullets which destroy the created objects (asteroids) around the ship. The game is completed when all asteroids have been shooting. To make the background more professional I added little star objects which were blinking. During the time of implementing the game I faced multiple issues which made me improve my problem-solving skills.
